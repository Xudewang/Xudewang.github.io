My works focus on galaxy morphology and structure. I also want to explore the formation and evolution of galaxies. 

I was born in [Chaoyang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaoyang,_Liaoning) City, Liaoning Province, and grew up in Xizhong Island （西中岛） by the Bohai Sea in [Dalian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalian) City, Liaoning Province.
